# ComorbidityIndexes.jl

Analysing health data often requires adjusting for patient
comorbidities. Various indexes or scores have been created for this.
Two of the most common are the Charlson Comorbidity Index and the
Elixhauser comorbidity score.

This package allows assigning Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity
flags and scores using ICD-10 codes published by Quan et al.
